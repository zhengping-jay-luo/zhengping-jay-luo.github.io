      <h2>Tips for a Successful Research Project</h2>
      <ul class="big-indent">
        <li>Please view this project as an opportunity to develop your leadership skills, teamwork spirit, and communication capabilities. They are vital for your future career.</li>
        <li>Please note that all team members are expected to contribute to the term project in a balanced and equitable manner. Throughout the semester, each student has full flexibility to leave a team, join another team, or form a new team at any time.</li>    
        <li>Take time to get to know your classmates first—collaborate on class-related tasks and observe each other's strengths. When you're ready, aim to form a team with a diverse set of skills and expertise to enhance your project’s success.</li>
        <li>Choose a topic that genuinely interests your team members. Passion for the subject matter can drive motivation and creativity.</li>
        <li>Work on something that has potential to serve your long-term career goals. For example, a project that could put in your resume, you can talk with your interviewers.</li>
        <li>Conduct thorough literature reviews to understand the current state of research in your chosen area. This will help you identify gaps and formulate relevant research questions.</li>
        <li>Practice your presentation multiple times to ensure clarity and confidence during the actual delivery. Consider recording a rehearsal to identify areas for improvement.</li>
        <li>If you are nervous about public speaking or unsure how to create a presentation, a highly effective approach is to study example presentations such as <a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED</a> talks, imitate their style, and practice multiple times before your actual presentation.</li>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><strong>Q1: Can I change my project topic after the initial proposal submission?</strong></p>
      <p>A1: Yes, you can change your project topic after the initial proposal submission. However, please note that changing your term project topic after the initial deadline will result in resubmission and re-grade of all previous term project submissions. Make-up submissions (including topic changing submissions) for the proposal, implementation, and poster/slides preparation deadlines are allowed, but only 80\% of the earned credit will be awarded.</p>

      <p><strong>Q2: Can I work on a project that is not related to the topics covered in this course?</strong></p>
      <p>A2: No, it is each team's burden to justify why the project is related to this class. Projects that are not related to topics discussed in this class will get no credits.</p>
      <p><strong>Q3: How do I find a good research topic?</strong></p>
      <p>A3: Start by exploring topics that interest you. Consider the relevance and significance of potential topics, review existing literature to identify gaps, and narrow down your focus to a specific research question. Seek feedback from peers and instructors to refine your topic. Go to job hunting webistes and review job descriptions to identify skills and knowledge that are in demand, and build those skills through your research project.</p>
