        <p>The goal of academic writing is to present new insights or perspectives about the world—ideas that readers may not already know—making originality a key to success. It follows a structured and formal style intended to communicate ideas clearly, logically, and persuasively. Helpful tips for effective academic writing include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Evidence-based arguments:</strong> Academic writing requires objective, evidence-based arguments rather than personal opinions or unsupported claims. Therefore, one should always support arguments with data (such as collected datasets or experimental results), analysis (such as mathematical proofs or derivations), or references from credible sources (including books, peer-reviewed academic articles, and technical reports). <strong>Most websites are not considered credible sources.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Formal and objective tone:</strong> Academic writing employs a formal tone that is neutral, objective, and narrative in style. It avoids colloquialisms, slang, and emotional language. Writers are expected to use the third person rather than the first person—for example, avoiding pronouns such as "I", "me", or "we", also, avoiding being too personal, such as using "you".</li>
          <li>Avoid using contractions such as 'don't' or 'can't'; use 'do not' or 'cannot' instead, if needed. Also, refrain from overly casual language. Choose precise vocabulary and avoid vague expressions like "a lot", "stuff", "perhaps", "maybe", etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Focused and well structured:</strong> Divide long texts into chapters or sections with clear headings. Use short, focused paragraphs, each beginning with a topic sentence. Ensure smooth and logical transitions between paragraphs to guide the reader through your argument.</li>
          <li>Use short, and straightforward sentences if possible.</li>
          <li>Clearly outlining your methodology and being honest about the limitations of your research.</li>
        </ul>
