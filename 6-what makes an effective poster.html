        <p>Posters are widely used in the academic community, and most conferences include poster presentations as part of their programs. A poster should be viewed as a snapshot of your work, designed to engage viewers in a dialogue. It typically combines brief, focused text with tables, graphs, images, and other visual elements to convey your key findings. You can download free poster templates from platforms such as <a href="https://www.posternerd.com/sciposters-templates" target="_blank">poster nerd</a>, <a href="https://www.posterpresentations.com/free-poster-templates.html" target="_blank">PosterPresentations</a>. There's also an informative video on how to structure poster content, which you can view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtyFp0AEsck&t=330s" target="_blank">here</a>. Some common practices for good poster design include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Large and readable font size. Important information should be readable from about 10 feet away.</li>
          <li>Text is clear and to the point, simply and tightly written. Word count of about 300 to 800 words.</li>
          <li>Use of bullets, numbering, and headlines make it easy to read.</li>
          <li>Focus on key findings or takeaways rather than exhaustive detail.</li>
          <li>Effective use of graphics, color and fonts, make it visual appealing. A picture worth 1K words!</li>
          <li>Each visual should serve a purpose—avoid decorative or unrelated images.</li>
          <li>Keep a balanced layout with sufficient white space to reduce visual clutter.</li>
          <li>Design your poster so that your audience can grasp the key points within two minutes or less of reading.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The poster dimensions used for this research project is 48 × 36. The instructor will provide necessary help on the printing.</p>
