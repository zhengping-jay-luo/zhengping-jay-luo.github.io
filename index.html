        <li><b>FuTech Lab</b>: Our lab focuses on researching future-oriented technologies. We aim to drive positive and transformative changes in broader society by advancing cutting-edge innovations and exploring next-generation technologies. Our current research centers on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security, with an emphasis on the robustness, privacy, and safety of machine-learning (ML) systems deployed in real-world settings. This includes LLM-based systems (e.g., SpeechGPT), networked and IoT environments, and emerging quantum-enabled workflows.</li>
        <li><b>CURES Program</b>: Our Collaborative Undergraduate RESearch Experience (CURES) Program leverages experiential learning to integrate authentic research experiences into undergraduate classrooms. The program empowers our talented undergraduates with a full-spectrum experience in the research lifecycle—strengthening hands-on technical skills, sharpening critical thinking abilities, and cultivating leadership mindsets. As a powerhouse for next-generation leaders in science, technology and beyond, the CURES Program prepares students to thrive in advanced research environments and innovation-driven careers. </li>
      </ul>
